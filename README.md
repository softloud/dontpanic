dontpanic
=========

The goal of dontpanic is to be the coding equivalent of a towel. My helper functions are parked here. Work in progress, use at own risk.

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code

Signifiers
----------

I'll bet I'm trying to reinvent the wheel here, there's probably a mountain of literature on how to track projects using emoji on github.

But right now I've got less than two weeks to prepare for a talk on visualisation to people who are very smart. (I also really like them and want them to be my friends, and if I take on too much right now I'll be too wild-eyed crazy to be approachable.)

So, I'm just going to dive in and make something up to get me through the next few weeks.

### Structure

I want to run my eyes down commit history and have things pop out.

You're usually looking for an issue not a person, so the issue should be on the lefthand side. The next question might be who made that change. So, signifier for person goes at the end.

> :issue\_emoji: Some commit message. :person\_emoji:
