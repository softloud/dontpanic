["dontpanic.html", "2 dontpanic 2.1 Example 2.2 Signifiers", " 2 dontpanic The goal of dontpanic is to be the coding equivalent of a towel. My helper functions are parked here. Work in progress, use at own risk. 2.1 Example This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: ## basic example code # Yeah, I wouldn&#39;t trust any code I haven&#39;t touched for a few weeks. It has a life of its own. 2.2 Signifiers I’ll bet I’m trying to reinvent the wheel here, there’s probably a mountain of literature on how to track projects using emoji on github. But right now I’ve got less than two weeks to prepare for a talk on visualisation to people who are very smart. (I also really like them and want them to be my friends, and if I take on too much right now I’ll be too wild-eyed crazy to be approachable.) So, I’m just going to dive in and make something up to get me through the next few weeks. 2.2.1 Structure I want to run my eyes down commit history and have things pop out. You’re usually looking for an issue not a person, so the issue should be on the lefthand side. The next question might be who made that change. So, signifier for person goes at the end. :issue_emoji: Some commit message. :person_emoji: 2.2.2 Signifiers Perhaps I should just wrap these up in some functions. :notes: pandagrrl :notes:. :musical_score: :musical_score: Documentation. :musical_keyboard: :musical_keyboard: Updated README.Rmd. :cat: :cat: Any work on functions. :dizzy: :dizzy: Testing. :cat2: :cat2: Simulations.
